      <p>FarmBuild is delivered by Agriculture Victoria, a division of the Victorian Government's Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources (DEDJTR).</p>

	<a id="What does FarmBuild do?" class="anchor" href="#project-objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does FarmBuild do?</h1>

	<p>FarmBuild delivers agricultural science such as algorithms, calculators, and key agricultural datasets
	as online functions.  An open source repository of web services and application programming interfaces (API) 
	makes FarmBuild accessible to be used by anyone at any time.  Web service APIs and associated data sources, 
	and open source JavaScript API sample code and pages, are available for users to build their own digital 
	tools and support their clients. </p>	
	<img src="images/front_page/Optimized-supply_chain_2.jpg" width="806" height="193">
	
	<p>Current <a href="farmbuild_functions.html">online functions</a> available through FarmBuild include mapping, farm nutrient balance models and soil 
	information.  New functions and data delivery will be developed for FarmBuild over the coming years of 
	the project. For more information please visit the <a href="farmbuild_functions.html">Online functions</a> page.

	<h1>
	<a id="Who is FarmBuild for?" class="anchor" href="#project-objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who is FarmBuild for?</h1>

	<p>Commercial business and industry bodies will be the next users of FarmBuild. It is envisaged that most 
	agriculture businesses will need to collaborate with software developers to be able to utilise FarmBuild 
	effectively. The aim of the FarmBuild project is to work with industry bodies and software developers to 
	facilitate the use and application of FarmBuild, and grow and develop additional components of FarmBuild 
	based on the needs of our users. </p>

	<p>Ultimately, the end users of the FarmBuild agriculture services are the farmers, land managers and advisors 
	making decisions on farm to improve their agricultural businesses.   Application of the Victorian Governmentâ€™s 
	research science is essential to supporting these end users and meeting the demands of growing markets, 
	while demonstrating responsible management of natural resources.

	<a id="Why is FarmBuild different?" class="anchor" href="#project-objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is FarmBuild different?</h1>

	<p>This unique distribution model allows the Victorian Government to deliver agricultural research science 
	more effectively, without the demands of creating and maintaining the digital tools that support on-farm 
	decisions.  Users such as agricultural service providers, who have greater on-ground knowledge of what 
	science and technologies land managers require to improve on-farm practices, will be better equipped through 
	FarmBuild to develop their own digital tools.</p>

	<h1>
	<a id="Why do we need FarmBuild?" class="anchor" href="#project-objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why do we need FarmBuild?</h1>

	<p>The Victorian Government provides essential agricultural scientific research information and data to 
	a wide audience, including farmers, land managers, agricultural businesses, the education sector, other 
	research institutions and Government agencies.  Victorian Government agricultural research has developed, 
	enhanced and maintained a wide range of models, measurement tools and datasets to improve:</p>
	<ul>
      <li>the use of farming inputs (e.g. water and nutrients);</li>
	  <li>soil health;</li>
	  <li>product yield and quality; and</li>
	  <li>offsite impacts.</li>
      </ul> 
	<p>FarmBuild provides a way to translate this science into practical, everyday decision support on-farm 
	by leveraging digital technology and services.
