      <p>FarmBuild is delivered by Agriculture Victoria, a division of the Victorian Government's Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources (DEDTJR).</p>

	<a id="What does FarmBuild do?" class="anchor" href="#project-objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FarmBuild - Agriculture science web service API distribution model </h1>

	<p>FarmBuild delivers agricultural science such as algorithms, calculators, and key agricultural datasets
	as online functions.  An open source repository of web services and application programming interfaces (API) 
	makes FarmBuild accessible to be used by anyone at any time.  Web service APIs and associated data sources, 
	and open source JavaScript API sample code and pages, are available for users to build their own digital 
	tools and support their clients.   
	
	Current online functions available through FarmBuild include mapping, farm nutrient balance models and soil 
	information.  New functions and data delivery will be developed for FarmBuild over the coming years of 
	the project.

	</p>

	<a id="Who is FarmBuild for?" class="anchor" href="#project-objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FarmBuild - Agriculture science web service API distribution model </h1>

	<p>Commercial business and industry bodies will be the next users of FarmBuild. It is envisaged that most 
	agriculture businesses will need to collaborate with software developers to be able to utilise FarmBuild 
	effectively. The aim of the FarmBuild project is to work with industry bodies and software developers to 
	facilitate the use and application of FarmBuild, and grow and develop additional components of FarmBuild 
	based on the needs of our users.

	Ultimately, the end users of the FarmBuild agriculture services are the farmers, land managers and advisors 
	making decisions on farm to improve their agricultural businesses.   Application of the Victorian Government’s 
	research science is essential to supporting these end users and meeting the demands of growing markets, 
	while demonstrating responsible management of natural resources.

	<h1>
	<a id="Why is FarmBuild different?" class="anchor" href="#project-objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FarmBuild - Agriculture science web service API distribution model </h1>

	<p>This unique distribution model allows the Victorian Government to deliver agricultural research science 
	more effectively, without the demands of creating and maintaining the digital tools that support on-farm 
	decisions.  Users such as agricultural service providers, who have greater on-ground knowledge of what 
	science and technologies land managers require to improve on-farm practices, will be better equipped through 
	FarmBuild to develop their own digital tools.

	</p>
	
	<h1>
	<a id="Why do we need FarmBuild?" class="anchor" href="#project-objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FarmBuild - Agriculture science web service API distribution model </h1>

	<p>The Victorian Government provides essential agricultural scientific research information and data to 
	a wide audience, including farmers, land managers, agricultural businesses, the education sector, other 
	research institutions and Government agencies.  Victorian Government agricultural research has developed, 
	enhanced and maintained a wide range of models, measurement tools and datasets to improve:
	<ul>
      <li>the use of farming inputs (e.g. water and nutrients);</li>
	  <li>soil health;</li>
	  <li>product yield and quality; and</li>
	  <li>offsite impacts.</li>
      <ul> 
	FarmBuild provides a way to translate this science into practical, everyday decision support on-farm 
	by leveraging digital technology and services.  

	</p>
<p>
The FarmBuild services are composed of an initial series of web service and open source code API’s developed by DEDJTR for consumption in third party systems. Specifically they include:
      </p>  

	<h1>FarmBuild APIs</h1>
      
    <h2>Web service API’s and associated data sources</h2>
      
     <p>
       The web services and associated data sources will be served
 off DEDJTR infrastructure. The web services are available to 
access from the GitHub ‘FarmBuild’ account. They will be 
provided with an agreed service level and will include:
      </p>
      
    <ul>
      <li>Web Feature Services </li>  
      <ul> 
            <li> <a href="http://farmbuild.github.io/farmbuild/2015-06-11-farmbuild%20soil%20wfs.html">Soils of the Goulburn Murray Irrigation Region </a></li>

            <li> <a href="http://farmbuild.github.io/farmbuild/2015-06-23-farmbuild%20soil%20area%20service.html">Soils Area Calculation Services</a> </li>
            <p>  This service will return calculated areas of soil types in the Goulburn Murray Irrigation Region for a defined area (ie.  Farm or paddock boundary) </p>
            <li> Prototype soil data web service </li>
            <p>  A prototype service is being offered for access to a snapshot 
of the Victorian Soil Information System data through the 
ANZSoilML standard. </p>
      </ul>
      </ul>
    <h2>Javascript based API sample code</h2>
      
      <p>
       The sample code has been documented and published 
with sample pages on the GitHub open source repository 
under the name of ‘FarmBuild’. The code has been 
architected to split the JavaScript calculations and 
services from the user interfaces (UI) and designed 
for reuse in third party systems. This allows third parties to
 deliver the services within their own look and feel and 
where needed leverage the base UI published on GitHub. 
The sample code includes:
      </p>
        
    
  <ul>    
    	<li><a href="http://farmbuild.github.io/farmbuild/2015-06-23-farmbuild%20web%20mapping.html">Web Mapping</a></li>
      <p>To support the deployment of mapping tools for application in agriculture DEDJTR has developed an open source farm mapping API javascript library and demonstration page that enables users or developers to map and access spatial farm data for application both within FarmBuild API's and their own environment</p>
      
    	<li><a href="http://farmbuild.github.io/farmbuild/farmbuild-farmdata.html">Farm Data</a></li>
      
      <p>To facilitate the exchange of information between FarmBuild applications and other on-line environments a farm data block has been established which stores all data generated by the FarmBuild applications within a simple JSON structure.  </p>
      
      <li><a href="2015-06-11-farmbuild nutrient management-overview.html">Farm Dairy Nutrient Calculator</a> </li>
      <p>A ‘Whole Farm Nutrient Balance Calculator’ for Australian dairy farms has been developed in partnership with Murray Goulburn, the Gardiner Foundation and DEDJTR. This javaScript library is a developer version of this calculator that can be used to model nutrient flow in and out of a dairy farms. Since Australian dairy farms generally import larger quantities of nutrients than they export, knowing the nutrient balance of a farm gives farmers the potential to save money.  </p>
    	
      <li><a href="http://farmbuild.github.io/farmbuild/2015-06-23-farmbuild%20soil%20sample%20importer.html">Soil Import Service</a></li>
      <p> To further support nutrient management on-farm a soil import API javascript library and demonstration page has been developed to enable import, linking and nutrient status classification of soil test data to a farm paddock structure as generated by web mapping applications </p>
      </ul>
