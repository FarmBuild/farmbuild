      <p>In meeting the demands of growing markets and delivering production gains whilst demonstrating responsible management of resources, Victorian agriculture industries face significant challenges in leveraging digital technologies and services to support their farm management decisions. </p>

	<a id="FarmBuild - Agriculture science web service API distribution model" class="anchor" href="#project-objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FarmBuild - Agriculture science web service API distribution model </h1>

	<p>DEDJTR is seeking to provide software and cloud based agriculture service  companies access to  
	research based outputs and key agricultural datasets as on-line functions that can be built into 
	service offerings for their client base across key Victorian agriculture industries of horticulture, 
	dairy, red meat and grains.  The ability for companies to access and integrate science based algorithms and 
	information with their systems means value can be added to the ARD knowledge base and provides ARD with 
	access to the rapidly expanding cloud based farm management services environment.

	</p>
<p>
The FarmBuild services are composed of an initial series of web service and open source code API’s developed by DEDJTR for consumption in third party systems. Specifically they include:
      </p>  

	<h1>FarmBuild APIs</h1>
      
    <h2>Web service API’s and associated data sources</h2>
      
     <p>
       The web services and associated data sources will be served
 off DEDJTR infrastructure. The web services are available to 
access from the GitHub ‘FarmBuild’ account. They will be 
provided with an agreed service level and will include:
      </p>
      
    <ul>
      <li>Web Feature Services </li>  
      <ul> 
            <li> <a href="http://farmbuild.github.io/farmbuild/2015-06-11-farmbuild%20soil%20wfs.html">Soils of the Goulburn Murray Irrigation Region </a></li>

      </ul>

    	<li>Soil Information Services </li>
          <ul>
            <li> <a href="http://farmbuild.github.io/farmbuild/2015-06-23-farmbuild%20soil%20area%20service.html">Soils Area Calculation Services</a> </li>
            <p>  This service will return calculated areas of soil types in the Goulburn Murray Irrigation Region for a defined area (ie.  Farm or paddock boundary) </p>
            <li> Prototype soil data web service </li>
            <p>  A prototype service is being offered for access to a snapshot 
of the Victorian Soil Information System data through the 
ANZSoilML standard. </p>
      </ul>
      </ul>
    <h2>Javascript based API sample code</h2>
      
      <p>
       The sample code has been documented and published 
with sample pages on the GitHub open source repository 
under the name of ‘FarmBuild’. The code has been 
architected to split the JavaScript calculations and 
services from the user interfaces (UI) and designed 
for reuse in third party systems. This allows third parties to
 deliver the services within their own look and feel and 
where needed leverage the base UI published on GitHub. 
The sample code includes:
      </p>
        
    
  <ul>    
    	<li><a href="http://farmbuild.github.io/farmbuild/2015-06-23-farmbuild%20web%20mapping.html">Web Mapping</a></li>
      <p>To support the deployment of mapping tools for application in agriculture DEDJTR has developed an open source farm mapping API javascript library and demonstration page that enables users or developers to map and access spatial farm data for application both within FarmBuild API's and their own environment</p>
      
    	<li><a href="http://farmbuild.github.io/farmbuild/farmbuild-farmdata.html">Farm Data</a></li>
      
      <p>To facilitate the exchange of information between FarmBuild applications and other on-line environments a farm data block has been established which stores all data generated by the FarmBuild applications within a simple JSON structure.  </p>
      
      <li><a href="2015-06-11-farmbuild nutrient management-overview.html">Farm Dairy Nutrient Calculator</a> </li>
      <p>A ‘Whole Farm Nutrient Balance Calculator’ for Australian dairy farms has been developed in partnership with Murray Goulburn, the Gardiner Foundation and DEDJTR. This javaScript library is a developer version of this calculator that can be used to model nutrient flow in and out of a dairy farms. Since Australian dairy farms generally import larger quantities of nutrients than they export, knowing the nutrient balance of a farm gives farmers the potential to save money.  </p>
    	
      <li><a href="http://farmbuild.github.io/farmbuild/2015-06-23-farmbuild%20soil%20sample%20importer.html">Soil Import Service</a></li>
      <p> To further support nutrient management on-farm a soil import API javascript library and demonstration page has been developed to enable import, linking and nutrient status classification of soil test data to a farm paddock structure as generated by web mapping applications </p>
      </ul>
