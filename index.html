      <p>Delivering spatial information for improved management of individual farms, entire
landscapes and sub-regions is critical for productivity improvement, land and water
management and to support farm extension activities.</p>

<h1>
<a id="driver-for-the-research" class="anchor" href="#driver-for-the-research" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Driver for the Research</h1>

<p>As part of the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources (DEDJTR) on-line
initiatives the FarmWeb 2.0 project will design, deploy and evaluate a web 2.0 spatial mapping and data
management program to enable farmers to improve productivity while reducing their environmental impact.
Agricultural industries are coming under increased external scrutiny from customers and regulators to
demonstrate environmental compliance. Over the last decade DEDJTR has taken the lead in investigating
the link between on-farm actions, productivity and environmental outcomes.</p>

<h1>
<a id="research-focus" class="anchor" href="#research-focus" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Research Focus</h1>

<p>The initial focus of this work will be applications in the Dairy industry. DEDJTR will work collaboratively with
Murray Goulburn Cooperative (MGC) Ltd to develop, trial and deploy a FarmWeb 2.0 on-line mapping and
nutrient management tool with their farmers.
The developed systems will aim to provide a two way flow of data between government, industry and
farmers/landholders.</p>

<a id="project-objectives" class="anchor" href="#project-objectives" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Objectives.</h1>

<p>The objectives of the Gardiner project “FarmWeb 2.0: A web-based nutrient topic package for the Victorian
Dairy Industry are:
1. To design, test and deploy, in conjunction with Murray Goulburn, a Web-based Nutrient
Management Topic Package (as a case study for the wider dairy industry) to examine the potential
to demonstrate on-farm best nutrient management practices.
2. To evaluate and communicate the usefulness and usability of a Web-based topic package as spatial
information tools for better production and Natural Resource Management outcomes on Victorian
dairy farms.</p>

<p>This is the nutrient calculator module of farm build javaScript library.</p>

<p>A nutrient balance calculator for Australian dairy farms:
In partnership with Murray Goulburn, DEDJTR has developed the science based ‘Dairy Farm Nutrient
Balance Model’. This javaScript library can be used to model nutrient flow in and out of your dairy farm. Since
Australian dairy farms generally import larger quantities of nutrients than they export, knowing the nutrient
status of your farm gives you the potential to save money.</p>

<a id="what-is-a-nutrient-balance-calculator" class="anchor" href="#what-is-a-nutrient-balance-calculator" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is a nutrient balance calculator?</h1>

<p>The nutrient balance model determines how efficiently a nutrient is being used on-farm. The amount of a
nutrient leaving in farm products (milk or animals) is subtracted from nutrient inputs to calculate the nutrient
balance (kg of nutrient per ha of land).</p>

<hr>

<p>The Whole Farm Nutrient Balance Calculator works with yearly totals. The following is the list of functions provided in this modules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Numbers of Animals purchased for the year (Heavy Cattle, Average Cattle, Yearlings, Weaned
young stock and Bobby Calves).</li>
<li>Forage Purchased (Hay and Silage) (Amount Purchased (Tonne/yr) by type).</li>
<li>Concentrate Purchased (Amount Purchased (Tonne/yr) by type).</li>
<li>Fertiliser Purchased (Amount Purchased (Tonne/yr) by type).</li>
<li>Number of Sold and Culled Cows (Heavy Cattle, Average Cattle, Yearlings, Weaned young stock
and Bobby Calves).</li>
<li>Milk Sold, Total Milk for Year (Litres) Total Fat/Protein (kg) Fat (kg/%) and Protein (kg/%).</li>
<li>Legume – Whole Farm average legume percentage (%) the percentage of pasture legumes growing
of the farm.</li>
</ul>
