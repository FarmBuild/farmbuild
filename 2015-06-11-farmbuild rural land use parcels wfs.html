  <p><b>Victorian Rural Parcel  Web Feature Service</b></p>
  
  <p>This is the 'Rural Parcel and Land Use''  web feature services(WFS) module of FarmBuild API services.</p>

  <p>This WFS is derived from the Victorian Land Use Information System (VLUIS) dataset with all urban parcels removed. This layer has been created by the Spatial Information Sciences Group of the Agriculture Research Division in the former Department of Environment and Primary Industries Victoria. The method used to create VLUIS is significantly different to traditional methods used to create land use information and has been designed to create regular and consistent data over time. It covers the entire landmass of Victoria and the attributes separately describes the land tenure, land use and land cover for each cadastral parcel across the state. The land cover data is sourced (created) annually whilst the land tenure and land use data is available bi-annually.Â </p>

<p>These maps are now available as a web feature service that can be intergrated into desktop mapping and design clients such as ArcGIS, QGIS and Autocad. The following link describes how to access the service.</p>
