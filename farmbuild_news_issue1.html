     <p><h1>Issue 1 - Spring 2016</h1> 
	 <h2>Communicating with you</h2>
	 <p>FarmBuild has been live for approximately one year now, and in that time we have been hard at work delivering services and features.  
	 Hosting a webinar in July and a Hack Day in August this year started to spread the word about FarmBuild and what it can do.</p>
	<p>We want to keep communicating with you; including those of you who have used FarmBuild, who use FarmBuild, or who want to use FarmBuild.  New 
	services and features are being developed, and new apps and tools are being created by partners as a result.</p>
	<p>Google+ will also give you up-to-date information on <a href="https://plus.google.com/105401735378907284642">FarmBuild</a>.  Follow the page with your own Google+ account, 
	or request to join the private community ‘FarmBuild Developer’ by emailing Hayden Lewis.  You can also subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWcc0Vtwk39g7wBPdSrUevA">
	FarmBuild YouTube Channel</a> where some short videos have been uploaded to assist you.</p> 
	<p>This quarterly newsletter provides a brief update of new ideas, new features, and stories of FarmBuild applications.  Please share with colleagues and friends.  
	Alternatively, if you wish to be removed from the newsletter email list, please email <a href="mailto:Gemma.Heemskerk@ecodev.vic.gov.au">Gemma.Heemskerk@ecodev.vic.gov.au</a>.</p>
	<p>We encourage this communication to be two-way; your suggestions and review of FarmBuild’s services and features is essential to its success.  
	We welcome you to contact us at any time - <a href="mailto:Hayden.Lewis@ecodev.vic.gov.au">Hayden.Lewis@ecodev.vic.gov.au</a>.</p>

	<p>The FarmBuild Dairy Nutrient Calculator has had benchmarking whisker charts added!  Benchmarking parameters estimated from

	Programming Interface (API). For further details visit <a href="https://github.com/FarmBuild">https://github.com/FarmBuild</a>.</p>

	<h2>Register for FarmBuild Services</h2>
	<p>FarmBuild registration is a once off process to:<ul>
		<li>capture FarmBuild user information;</li>
		<li>provide access to FarmBuild web services through authentication; and</li>
		<li>provide a communication link to the FarmBuild support services.</li></ul></p>

	<h2>Case Study - Farm Records</h2>
	<p>Farm Records provides a collaborative platform for a wide range of agricultural software, support services and decision support tools. Farm Records aims to make 
	your data accessible to the many science and decision tools that have been created by Government and industry, of which FarmBuild is one.  Developed by Internet Creative, 
	Farm Records has adopted FarmBuild as a package on its platform.  For further information visit <a href="http://www.farmrecords.com.au/">FarmRecords.com.au</a>.</p>
