  <p><b>Farm Build Whole Farm Dairy Nutrient Calculator</b></p>
  
<p>This is the ‘Whole farm Dairy Nutrient Calculator’ module of farmbuild javaScript library.</p>

<p>A ‘Whole Farm Nutrient Balance Calculator’ for Australian dairy farms has been developed in partnership with Murray Goulburn, the Gardiner Foundation and  DEDJTR. This javaScript library is a developer version of this calculator that can be used to model nutrient flow in and out of  a dairy farms. Since Australian dairy farms generally import larger quantities of nutrients than they export, knowing the nutrient balance of a farm gives farmers the  potential to save money.</p>


<p>#What is a nutrient balance calculator?
The nutrient balance calculator determines how efficiently a nutrient is being used on-farm. The amount of a
nutrient leaving in farm products (milk or animals) is subtracted from nutrient inputs to calculate the nutrient balance (kg of nutrient per ha of land).</p>

  <p>The ‘Whole Farm Nutrient Balance Calculator’  works with yearly totals. The following is the list of nutrient calculator(N, P, K, S, Ca and Mg) functions provided in this package:</p>
  
  <li>Nutrient inputs and outputs for Animals purchased and sold for the year (Heavy Cattle, Average Cattle, Yearlings, Weaned young stock and Bobby Calves).</li>
  <li>Nutrient value of Forages Purchased (Hay and Silage) (Amount Purchased (Tonne/yr) by type).</li>
  <li>Nutrient value of Concentrates Purchased (Amount Purchased (Tonne/yr) by type).</li>
  <li>Nutrient value of Fertilisers Purchased (Amount Purchased (Tonne/yr) by type).</li>
  <li>Nutrient value of Milk Sold, Total Milk for Year (Litres) Total Fat/Protein (kg) Fat (kg/%) and Protein (kg/%).</li>
  <li>Nitrogen fixation by Legumes based on Whole Farm average legume percentage (%) the percentage of pasture legumes growing of the farm.</li>

  <p>The ‘Whole Farm Nutrient Balance Calculator’ for Australian dairy farms was developed through The ‘Accounting for Nutrients on Australian Dairy Farms’ project (A4N). It has developed a nationally agreed nutrient accounting framework for N, P, K, S, Ca and Mg for the Australian dairy industry <a href="http://www.accounting4nutrients.com.au"> www.accounting4nutrients.com.au</a></p>
