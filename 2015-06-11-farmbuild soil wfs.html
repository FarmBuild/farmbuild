  <p><b>Soils of the Gouburn Murray Irrigation District (GMID) Web Feature Service</b></p>
  
<p>This is the 'GMID Soils'  web feature services module of FarmBuild API services.</p>

<p> The soils of the GMID have been described as part of extensive soil surveys undertaken in the 40's, 50's and 60's. Soil surveys were carried out by soil auger with holes 20 m to 400 m apart at depths between 1.2 m and 2.1 m. The surveyors then examined the horizons of the profile and noted their texture, colour, thickness, and the presence of lime and gypsum. Soil maps were then prepared using aerial photography and digitised to provide detailed soil mapping as depicted below.</p>

<p>Farm Build Whole Farm Dairy Nutrient Calculator Sources</p>

  <p>The ‘Whole Farm Nutrient Balance Calculator’ for Australian dairy farms was developed through The ‘Accounting for Nutrients on Australian Dairy Farms’ project (A4N). It has developed a nationally agreed nutrient accounting framework for N, P, K, S, Ca and Mg for the Australian dairy industry <a href="http://www.accounting4nutrients.com.au"> www.accounting4nutrients.com.au</a></p> 

  <p>The principal DEDJTR researchers are:</p>
  <li>Dr. Cameron Gourley, Project Leader and Principal Research Scientist, Ellinbank. Victoria.</li>
  <li>Ivor Awy, Senior Techical Officer, Ellinbank.  Victoria</li>

  <p> As part of the FarmWeb (www.depi.vic.gov.au/agriculture-and-food/dairy/farmweb-2.0-online-spatial-information-tools-to-improve-farm-productivity) and FarmBuild projects.</p>
  <p>This calculator has been redeveloped into javascript based modular web services by </p> 
  <li>Dr Sirajul Islam, Research Scientist (ICT), Agriculture Research, DEDJTR, Bendigo.  Victoria.</li>
  <li>Spatial Vision Consulting</li>
  
  <p>A guide on how to interpret and present the outputs from the calculator is linked below.</p>
