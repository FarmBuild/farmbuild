  <p><b>Soils of the Gouburn Murray Irrigation District (GMID) Web Feature Service</b></p>
  
<p>This is the 'GMID Soils'  web feature services module of FarmBuild API services.</p>

<p> The soils of the GMID have been described as part of extensive soil surveys undertaken in the 40's, 50's and 60's. Soil surveys were carried out by soil auger with holes 20 m to 400 m apart at depths between 1.2 m and 2.1 m. The surveyors then examined the horizons of the profile and noted their texture, colour, thickness, and the presence of lime and gypsum. Soil maps were then prepared using aerial photography and digitised to provide detailed soil mapping as depicted below.</p>

<p>You can find more  information on the soil surveys conducted in this region on the VRO website</p>

<p>These maps are now available as a web feature service that can be intergrated into desktop mapping and design clients such as ArcGIS, QGIS and Autocad. The following link describes how to access the service.</p>
