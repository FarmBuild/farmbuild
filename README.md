# FarmBuild
The FarmBuild services are composed of an initial series of web service and open source code API’s developed by DEDJTR for consumption in third party systems. Specifically they include:

- **FarmBuild Core** <br/>
FarmBuild Core provides Common functionalities used in FarmBuild components.<br/>
These functionalities include google analytic, collection api and validation module. It is primarily used as an internal dependency in higher level components such as: Dairy Nutrient Calculator, Web Mapping and FarmData.<br/>
Some of its apis, like google analytics, are exposed as part higher level components' api.<br/>

- **FarmData** <br/>
 To facilitate the exchange of information between FarmBuild applications and other on-line environments a farm data block has been established which stores all data generated by the FarmBuild applications within a simple JSON structure.<br/>

- **Web Mapping** <br/>
Web Mapping is an open source farm mapping API javascript library. A demonstration page is provided as part of examples in web mapping repository that shows how users or developers can map and access spatial farm data for application both within FarmBuild API's and their own environment.<br/>

- **Dairy Nutrient Calculator** <br/>
This javaScript library can be used to model nutrient flow in and out of a dairy farms. Since Australian dairy farms generally import larger quantities of nutrients than they export, knowing the nutrient balance of a farm gives farmers the potential to save money.<br/>

- **Soil Sample Importer** <br/>
To further support nutrient management on-farm a soil import API javascript library and demonstration page has been developed to enable import, linking and nutrient status classification of soil test data to a farm paddock structure as generated by web mapping applications.<br/>

- **Web service API’s and associated data sources**<br/>
The web services and associated data sources will be served off DEDJTR infrastructure. The web services are available to access from the GitHub ‘FarmBuild’ account. They will be provided with an agreed service level, but the source code is not availabe.<br/>
You can find an example of how you can access these web services by going through examples found in the Web Services Demo github repository.<br/>
https://github.com/FarmBuild/farmbuild-web-services-demo

  Web services include:

    - Web Feature Services<br/>
      - Soils of the Goulburn Murray Irrigation Region
      - Victorian Rural Parcel Agricultural Land Use
  
    - Soil Information Services
      - Soils Area Calculation Services<br/>
        This service will return calculated areas of soil types in the Goulburn Murray Irrigation Region for a defined area (ie. Farm or paddock boundary)
  
      - Prototype soil data web service<br/>
      A prototype service is being offered for access to a snapshot of the Victorian Soil Information System data through the ANZSoilML standard.
