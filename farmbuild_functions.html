FarmBuild's online functions are composed of an initial series of web services, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and associated data sources, as well as 
open source JavaScript API sample code and pages. Developed by DEDJTR to be freely available for users to build their own digital tools and 
support their clients.
      </p>  
      
    <h2>Web services, APIs and associated data sources</h2>
      
     <p>
       The web services, APIs and associated data sources are served off DEDJTR infrastructure. These are available to access freely from the GitHub ‘FarmBuild’ account.  
	   A simple registration process is needed to access the Soil Information Service, and users will be provided with an agreed service level. 
      </p>

      <ul> 
            <li> <a href="http://farmbuild.github.io/farmbuild/2015-06-11-farmbuild%20soil%20wfs.html">Soils of the Goulburn Murray Irrigation District</a> 
			<p>Extensively surveyed in the 1940’s, 50’s and 60’s for texture, colour, thickness and the presence of lime and gypsum to between 1.2 m to 2.1 m 
			depth.  Soil maps were prepared using aerial photography and digitised to provide a detailed soil map. </p></li>
         
            <li> <a href="http://farmbuild.github.io/farmbuild/2015-06-11-farmbuild%20rural%20land%20use%20parcels%20wfs.html">Victorian Rural Parcel and Agricultural 
			Land Use</a> <p>Derived from the Victorian Land Use Information System (VLUIS) data set with urban parcels removed.  Covers the entire landmass of Victoria 
			and attributes separately describe land tenure, land use and land cover for each cadastral parcel across the State. For further information on the VLUIS project visit
			<a href="http://vro.agriculture.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vrosite.nsf/pages/vluis">Victorian Resources Online</a>.</p></li>

    	<li>Soil Information Services </li>
          <ul>
            <li> <a href="http://farmbuild.github.io/farmbuild/2015-06-23-farmbuild%20soil%20area%20service.html">Soil Area Calculation Service</a> <p>This service returns 
			spatial intersection of the Farm Data Block (farm boundary and paddocks 
			as defined by user) with the soil survey information currently known for the Goulburn Murray Irrigation District. </p> </li>    
      </ul></ul>
    <h2>Javascript based API sample code</h2>
      
      <p>Published on the GitHub open source repository for FarmBuild, the code has been architected to split the JavaScript calculations and services from 
	  the user interfaces and designed for reuse in third party systems.  This allows users to deliver the functions within their own digital tool with a unique 
	  look and feel to suit their agricultural business.  The sample code includes: </p>
        
    <ul>
		<li> <a href="http://farmbuild.github.io/farmbuild/farmbuild-farmdata.html">Farm Data</a> 
		<p>To facilitate the integration of various FarmBuild components, the 
		Farm Data Block is a block of data that can be created, used and shared.  The Farm Data Block stores all data generated by the FarmBuild components 
		within a simple JSON structure.</p></li>
		
		  <li> <a href="http://farmbuild.github.io/farmbuild/2015-06-23-farmbuild%20web%20mapping.html">Web Mapping</a></li>
	  <p>Designed to stand-alone, the web mapping sample can be integrated into new or existing systems by third parties. This is an important component 
	  required to develop applications that contain data with a spatial context. The web mapping sample includes the ability to:</p>
			<ul><li>search by address</li>
			<li>create/edit a farm boundary</li>
			<li>create farm paddocks</li>
			<li>attribute farm paddocks</li>
			<li>assign farm paddocks to paddock groups through a defined list in a JSON file</li>
			<li>export mapping data as JSON through the Farm Data Block JSON structure, or as GeoJSON and KML formats</li></ul>
  
	<p> Through the Farm Data Block JSON structure, the exports are interoperable with other FarmBuild components.</p>
	
	  <li> <a href="2015-06-11-farmbuild nutrient management-overview.html">Whole Farm Nutrient Balance Calculator (Dairy)</a> 
	  <p>A JavaScript library in a developer version of the 
	  Whole Farm Nutrient Balance Calculator for Australian dairy farms developed through the 'Accounting for Nutrients on Australian Dairy Farms (A4N)' project (refer to the publication Gourley et al. (2012) Animal Production Science, volume 52, pages 929–944). 
	  The A4N project developed a nationally agreed nutrient accounting framework for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, calcium and magnesium for the Australian dairy industry, 
	  modelling nutrient flow in and out of dairy farms.  Working with yearly totals,  the amount of nutrient leaving the farm in product (e.g. milk and animals) is subtracted from the amount 
	  of nutrient coming onto the farm (e.g. fertilisers, forage, concentrates). </p></li>
      	
      <li> <a href="http://farmbuild.github.io/farmbuild/2015-06-23-farmbuild%20soil%20sample%20importer.html">Soil Sample Importer</a>
	  <p>Designed as a stand-alone sample that can be integrated into new or existing systems by third parties.  The soil import API JavaScript library and demonstration page enable users 
	  to import, link and classify nutrient status of soil test data to a farm paddock structure.  The Soil Sample Importer is designed to write the data into 
	  the  specified JSON structure of the Farm Data Block.</p></li>
            </ul>
