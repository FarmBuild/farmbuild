    <p><b>Farm Build Farm Data</b></p>

    <p>The FarmBuild components, including the web services and the Javascript based API sample code, deal with a common
        view of a farm comprising one or more paddocks and these paddocks optionally grouped into paddock groups. The
        farm itself and the paddocks are each represented by a polygon, along with a name, area and possibly other
        information. There are a number of examples of farm data blocks in the FarmBuild GitHub repositories, such as <a
                href="https://github.com/FarmBuild/farmbuild-farmdata/blob/master/examples/susan-farm-final-example.json">this
            one.</a></p>

    <p>Although each component is built to be stand alone, it is expected that two or more of the components may be used
        together to support a number of steps in a user process. For example, you may wish to have a farmer first draw
        their farm and it's paddocks and then use the soil area service to determine the soil types by area within the
        farm and each of the paddocks.</p>

    <p>To facilitate the integration of the various components, a standard data model of a farm has been developed as
        part of FarmBuild, to serve as the shared block of data to be created, used by and passed between the
        components. This farm data block is passed into web services or loaded into the Javascript APIs, the farm data
        is parsed and used by the service or API and any data generated is added into the farm data block, before it is
        passed back from the web service or exported out of the API.</p>

    <p>Although this farm data block has been designed to meet the needs of the FarmBuild components in the first
        instance, it is hoped that in the future, it will be used to integrate with other software components and
        services, being extended as required. The diagram below illustrates how the farm data block may be created by
        and used in the farmBuild and potentially third party software components</p>
    <img alt="Example farm data block flow between FarmBuild components"
         src="images/farmdata/Farm_Data_Block_Flow_example.png">

    <p>Details of the farm data block and it&apos;s associated Javascript API can be found in the <a
            href="https://github.com/FarmBuild/farmbuild-farmdata">FarmBuild Farm Data GitHub repository</a> and it&apos;s
        <a href="https://github.com/FarmBuild/farmbuild-farmdata/wiki">wiki</a></p>

    <p>Where relevant, each of the FarmBuild components documents how it makes use of the farm data block - what it
        requires as an input and what it writes in to the data block as it&apos;s output. The FarmBuild web mapping
        component enables new farm data blocks to be created, exported and saved.</p>

    <p>The farm data block is a JSON (Javascript Object Notation) structure, making it easy to use in Javascript but
        also now the defacto standard for use with REST web services. The farm data block makes use of the GeoJSON
        standard for storing spatial features. Although the farm data block itself is not GeoJSON (since it needs to
        hold a wider range of data than spatial), the farm and paddock entities contain a "geometry" element which is
        standard geoJSON. This makes it easy to transform the farm data block into GeoJSON, although doing so
        necessarily discards some of the farm data which is not directly related to the farm and paddock features. The
        FarmBuild web mapping component includes buttons to export the farm data block to GeoJSON and to KML</p>

    <p>Note that it is not intended that third party software applications which use FarmBuild components will store
        data in the farm data block structure persistently. It is more likely they will store the farmer&apos;s data in
        a custom set of database tables and transform this data into and out of the farm data block structure as they
        call FarmBuild components</p>
