	<p><b>Q: As a business manager, do I need to understand web application development to use FarmBuild?</b></p>

	<p>A: No, as a business owner/manager, you only really need to understand the basic logic to these applications and services. When it comes to implementation, you 
	will need a web developer that does understand web application development.  Specifically, we recommend a developer that understands the following components: 
	Javascript, Openlayers 3, angularJS and HTML.</p>	
	
	<p><b>Q. How do I find someone (web developer) that can develop from the FarmBuild suite of tools and services?</b></p>

	<p>A: You could use an online resource like <a href="http://freelancer.com.au">freelancer.com.au</a>. There are plenty of these around however, if you prefer a personalised service, you may be 
	better off using something like the white pages so you can ask the developer some specific questions.  We recommend a developer who understands the following 
	components: Javascript, Openlayers 3, angularJS and HTML.</p>	
	
	<p><b>Q: How do I fit the FarmBuild web mapping component into my online web application?</b></p>

	<p>A: The FarmBuild web mapping component can be used two ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Use the existing GitHub sample code and add it to your website. You will need a web developer to tailor this to fit with the existing application.</li>
			<li>Use the API documentation to custom build the mapping component into your web application. You will need a web developer for this also.</li></ul>

	<p><b>Q: Why use FarmBuild web mapping if I have to customise code anyway?</b></p>

	<p>A: The web mapping component of FarmBuild is essentially a platform to the other FarmBuild tools such as the soil area service, dairy nutrient calculator, and 
	soil import service. They all require a mapping function that can capture farm and paddock areas. We have developed the web mapping component so developers can 
	understand how to integrate the tools and services into a web mapping application.</p>	

	<p><b>Q: What happens if we have trouble using the FarmBuild tools and services?</b></p>

	<p>A: There is an 'Issues' feature of the GitHub repository exactly for this purpose. If it is an urgent issue, you may also contact 
	<a href="mailto:Andy.McAllister@ecodev.vic.gov.au?subject=FarmBuild Enquiry">Andy.McAllister@ecodev.vic.gov.au</a></p>
	
	<p><b>Q: Why do I have to register to use the web services?</b></p>

	<p>A: As a Victorian Government department, we need to understand who is using these services and how they are being utilised. This allows us to manage system load, 
	plan for future development and keep engaged with our users.</p>
